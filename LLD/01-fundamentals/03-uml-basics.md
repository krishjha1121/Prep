# UML Basics - Visual Modeling for System Design

## 🎯 Overview

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** is a standardized visual modeling language used to specify, visualize, construct, and document software systems. It provides a common vocabulary and set of notations for creating diagrams that represent different aspects of a system.

## 🎨 Why UML Matters in LLD

- **Visual Communication**: Clear representation of system structure and behavior
- **Design Documentation**: Permanent record of design decisions
- **Team Collaboration**: Common language for developers, architects, and stakeholders
- **Problem Identification**: Spot design issues before implementation
- **Code Generation**: Some tools can generate code from UML diagrams

## 🏗️ Structural Diagrams

> ### 1. Class Diagram

**Most important for LLD** - Shows classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.

#### Class Diagram Elements

| Symbol          | Meaning        | Example                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `+`             | Public         | `+play()`                |
| `-`             | Private        | `-city: int`             |

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Person {
        - name : String
        - age : int
        - address : Address
        - phone : Phone
        + adoptPet(pet: Pet) : void
    }

    class Address {
        - street : String
        - city : String
        - state : String
        - zipCode : String
    }

    class Phone {
        - phoneNumber : String
        - phoneType : PhoneType
    }

    class PhoneType {
        <<enumeration>>
        HOME
        WORK
        MOBILE
    }

    class Pet {
        <<interface>>
        + play() : void
        + specialMeow() : void
    }

    class Animal {
        <<abstract>>
        - name : String
        - age : int
        + eat() : void
        + sleep() : void
    }

    class Dog {
        - breed : String
        + bark() : void
        + play() : void
        + specialMeow() : void
    }

    class Cat {
        - furColor : String
        + meow() : void
        + play() : void
        + specialMeow() : void
    }

    %% Relationships
    Person --> Address
    Person --> Phone
    Phone --> PhoneType

    Person --> Pet : adoptPet

    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
    Pet <|.. Dog
    Pet <|.. Cat
```

</div>

- The relationships between the classes are as follows:
    - Inheritance: `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal`.
    - Realization/Implementation: `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `Pet` interface.
    - Aggregation: `Person` has an aggregation relationship with `Pet`, indicating that a person can have multiple pets.
    - Composition:`Person` has a composition relationship with `Address`, indicating that an address cannot exist without a person.
    - Association: `Person` has an association relationship with `Phone`, indicating that a person can have multiple phone numbers.
      Dependency: `Phone` depends on the `PhoneType` enumeration for the `phoneType` attribute.

> ### 2. Object Diagram

- Shows instances of classes at a specific moment in time.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
graph TD
    subgraph "Object Diagram - Online Shopping"
        A["customer1: Customer<br/>name = 'John Doe'<br/>email = 'john@email.com'"]
        B["order1: Order<br/>orderId = 'ORD-001'<br/>total = 299.99<br/>status = 'Processing'"]
        C["product1: Product<br/>name = 'Laptop'<br/>price = 999.99<br/>stock = 5"]
        D["orderItem1: OrderItem<br/>quantity = 1<br/>unitPrice = 999.99"]

        A --> B
        B --> D
        D --> C
    end
```

</div>

> ### 3. Component Diagram

Shows how components are organized and their dependencies.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
graph TD
    subgraph "E-commerce System Components"
        A[User Interface]
        B[Order Management]
        C[Payment Processing]
        D[Inventory Management]
        E[Database Layer]
        F[External Payment Gateway]

        A --> B
        A --> D
        B --> C
        B --> E
        C --> F
        C --> E
        D --> E
    end
```

</div>

## 🎭 Behavioral Diagrams

> ### 1. Use Case Diagram

- Shows system functionality from user's perspective.
- A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of how different users (also called actors) interact with a system.
- It’s like a bird’s-eye view of the system’s functionality without getting into any code.
- It answers **"What can users do with this system?"**

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'flowchart': {'curve': 'linear'}}}%%
flowchart LR
  %% actors (outside the system boundary)
  Customer[Customer]
  Admin[Admin]

  %% system boundary (subgraph) with use cases as ovals
  subgraph Online_Banking_System["Online Banking System"]
    direction TB
    UC1((Login))
    UC2((View Balance))
    UC3((Transfer Money))
    UC4((Pay Bills))
    UC5((Generate Reports))
    UC6((Manage Accounts))
  end

  %% actor -> use case links
  Customer --> UC1
  Customer --> UC2
  Customer --> UC3
  Customer --> UC4

  Admin --> UC1
  Admin --> UC5
  Admin --> UC6

  %% indicate "includes" (dotted arrows) — visually similar to UML <<include>>
  UC2 -.-> UC1
  UC3 -.-> UC1
  UC4 -.-> UC1

```

> ### 2. Sequence Diagram

- Shows how objects interact over time.
- A sequence diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that shows how objects in a system interact with each other, step by step.
- It focuses on the order of messages exchanged between different components or actors to achieve a particular task or use case.
- **"Who is doint what and when ? "**
- A **Sequence Diagram** in UML is used to represent the flow of messages between different objects or components over time.
- It shows **how objects interact** through different types of **messages**.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UserInterface
    participant OM as OrderManager
    participant PP as PaymentProcessor
    participant DB as Database

    U->>UI: Place Order
    UI->>OM: createOrder(items)

    OM->>DB: saveOrder(order)
    DB-->>OM: orderSaved

    OM->>PP: processPayment(amount, cardInfo)
    PP->>PP: validateCard()

    alt Payment Successful
        PP-->>OM: paymentSuccess(transactionId)
        OM->>DB: updateOrderStatus(orderId, "PAID")
        OM-->>UI: orderConfirmation
        UI-->>U: Order Confirmed
    else Payment Failed
        PP-->>OM: paymentFailed(reason)
        OM->>DB: updateOrderStatus(orderId, "FAILED")
        OM-->>UI: orderRejected
        UI-->>U: Payment Failed
    end
```

### 🌏 Types of Messages in Sequence Diagrams :

A message represents a communication between lifelines (objects/actors). Below are the commonly used UML message types with concise explanations and Mermaid examples.

1. Synchronous Message (Call)

- Meaning: Sender waits for the receiver to finish (blocking call).
- Notation: Solid line with a filled arrowhead to the receiver, often followed by a reply.
- Mermaid: Use `->>` for call and `-->>` for reply. You can show activation with `activate`/`deactivate`.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Service
    participant R as Repository

    C->>S: getOrder(id)
    activate S
    S->>R: fetchOrder(id)
    activate R
    R-->>S: Order
    deactivate R
    S-->>C: OrderDTO
    deactivate S
```

2. Asynchronous Message (Signal)

- Meaning: Sender does not wait (non-blocking); control returns immediately.
- Notation: In UML, an open arrow. In Mermaid, use `-)` for async messages.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as UI
    participant Q as EventQueue
    participant WL as WorkerListener

    UI-)Q: enqueue(Job)
    Q-)WL: dispatch(Job)
    Note over UI,Q: UI continues without waiting
```

3. Reply / Return Message

- Meaning: Response to a previous call.
- Notation: Dashed line back to the caller.
- Mermaid: `-->>` from callee to caller.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as API
    participant Auth as AuthService

    A->>Auth: authenticate(token)
    Auth-->>A: AuthResult
```

4. Create Message

- Meaning: Creates a new lifeline instance.
- Notation: Arrow to the created lifeline’s head; the lifeline starts at that point.
- Mermaid: Use `create participant` before the first message to it.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Factory
    participant O as Order
    F->>O: init(customer, items)
    Note over O: Lifeline starts here (created)
```

5. Destroy (Delete) Message

- Meaning: Terminates a lifeline.
- Notation: Message to an X at the end of the lifeline; no further messages after.
- Mermaid: Use `destroy participant` (and optionally `--x` arrow for emphasis).

```mermaid

%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant Session

    Session ->> Session: logout
    destroy Session
```

6. Self Message (Recursive/Internal Call)

- Meaning: An object sends a message to itself.
- Notation: A U-shaped arrow back to the same lifeline.
- Mermaid: Use `A->>A`.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant Calc as Calculator

    Calc->>Calc: computeSubtotal(lines)
    activate Calc
    Calc->>Calc: applyDiscounts()
    Calc-->>Calc: subtotal
    deactivate Calc
```

7. Found Message

- Meaning: Message with unknown sender (arrives from outside the system boundary).
- Notation: Arrow originating from a filled circle to a lifeline (conceptual in UML).
- Mermaid: Not directly supported; approximate by using a dedicated External participant.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant Ext as External
    participant S as Service

    Ext-->>S: incomingWebhook(payload)
    Note over S: Found message (origin outside system)
```

8. Lost Message

- Meaning: Message whose receiver is unknown or not modeled.
- Notation: Arrow to a filled circle at the edge (conceptual in UML).
- Mermaid: Not directly supported; approximate by sending to a placeholder participant.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Service
    participant Unknown as <unknown>

    S-->>Unknown: notifyAll(event)
    Note over S,Unknown: Lost message (receiver not modeled)
```

> Notes

- Guarded/conditional flows (alt/opt), loops, and parallel blocks are interaction fragments, not message types, though they commonly wrap messages.
- Activation bars represent time the receiver is active/processing; helpful but optional.

> ### 3. Activity Diagram

- Shows workflow and business processes.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]) --> Input[Enter Login Credentials]
    Input --> Validate{Valid Credentials?}

    Validate -->|No| Error[Show Error Message]
    Error --> Input

    Validate -->|Yes| CheckRole{Check User Role}

    CheckRole -->|Admin| AdminDash[Load Admin Dashboard]
    CheckRole -->|Customer| CustomerDash[Load Customer Dashboard]
    CheckRole -->|Manager| ManagerDash[Load Manager Dashboard]

    AdminDash --> AdminActions[Admin Functions]
    CustomerDash --> CustomerActions[Customer Functions]
    ManagerDash --> ManagerActions[Manager Functions]

    AdminActions --> End([End])
    CustomerActions --> End
    ManagerActions --> End
```

</div>

> ### 4. State Machine Diagram

- Shows states of an object and transitions between states.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Submitted : submit()
    Draft --> Cancelled : cancel()

    Submitted --> UnderReview : review()
    Submitted --> Cancelled : cancel()

    UnderReview --> Approved : approve()
    UnderReview --> Rejected : reject()
    UnderReview --> NeedsRevision : requestRevision()

    NeedsRevision --> Submitted : resubmit()
    NeedsRevision --> Cancelled : cancel()

    Approved --> Published : publish()
    Approved --> Archived : archive()

    Rejected --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
    Published --> Archived : archive()
    Archived --> [*]
```

</div>

## 🔗 Relationships in UML

> ### 1. Association (Simple Association)

- General relationship between classes.
- Association represents a "uses-a" relationship between two classes where one class uses or interacts with the other.
- Example : A `Car` has a`Driver`. Car class uses, or references `Driver` class.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Car {
        -driver: Driver
        +Car(driver : Driver)
        +drive(): void
    }

    class Driver {
        -name: String
        +Driver(name : String)
    }

    Car --> Driver : has-a
```

</div>

> ### 2. Aggregation (Has-a)

- "Part-of" relationship where parts can exist independently.
- Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship where one class (the whole) contains another class (the part), but the contained class can exist independently.
- Example: A `Car` class has an `Engine` class but the Engine class can exist without the Car class.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Car {
        -model: String
        -year: int
        -engine : Engine
    }
    class Engine {
        -type: String
        -horsePower: int
    }

    Car o-- Engine : has
```

</div>

> ### 3. Composition (Part-of)

- Strong ownership where parts cannot exist without the whole.
- Composition represents a strong "has-a" relationship where the part cannot exist without the whole. If the whole is destroyed, the parts are also destroyed.

- Example: A `House` class is composed of `Room` class but the Room class can not exist without the House class.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class House {
        -address: String
        -size: int
    }

    class Room {
        -name: String
        -area: double
    }

    House *-- Room : contains

    note for Room "Rooms cannot exist\nwithout House"
```

</div>

> ### 4. Inheritance (Is-a)

- Generalization/specialization relationship.
- Inheritance (or Generalization) represents an "is-a" relationship where one class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods of another class (superclass).
- Example: A `Dog` class and a `Cat` class inherit from an `Animal` class, as both dogs and cats are animals.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        <<abstract>>
        -name: String
        +eat()
        +sleep()
        +makeSound()*
    }

    class Dog {
        -breed: String
        +makeSound()
        +wagTail()
    }

    class Cat {
        -lives: int
        +makeSound()
        +purr()
    }

    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

</div>

> ### 5. Realization/Implementation

- Implementation of interface by a class.
- Realization or implementation represents a relationship between a class and an interface, where the class implements the methods declared in the interface.
- Example: A `Rectangle` class and a `Circle` class implement the `Shape` interface, which declares a getArea() method.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Drawable {
        <<interface>>
        +draw()
        +move(x, y)
    }

    class Circle {
        -radius: double
        +draw()
        +move(x, y)
        +calculateArea()
    }

    class Rectangle {
        -width: double
        -height: double
        +draw()
        +move(x, y)
        +calculateArea()
    }

    Drawable <|.. Circle
    Drawable <|.. Rectangle
```

</div>

> ### 6. Dependency

- One class uses another class.
- Dependency represents a "uses" relationship where a change in one class (the supplier) may affect the other class (the client).
- Example: A `Customer` class uses an `Order` class to place order.

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class OrderProcessor {
        +processOrder(order)
    }

    class EmailService {
        +sendEmail(recipient, message)
    }

    class Order {
        -orderId: String
        -amount: double
    }

    OrderProcessor ..> EmailService : uses
    OrderProcessor ..> Order : uses
```

</div>

## 📊 Multiplicity Indicators

| Notation      | Meaning         |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `1`           | Exactly one     |
| `0..1`        | Zero or one     |
| `*` or `0..*` | Zero or more    |
| `1..*`        | One or more     |
| `2..5`        | Between 2 and 5 |
| `3`           | Exactly 3       |

### Example with Multiplicity

<div align = "center">

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'default'}}%%
classDiagram
    class Library {
        - name : String
        - address : String
    }

    class Book {
        - isbn : String
        - title : String
        - author : String
    }

    class Member {
        - memberId : String
        - name : String
    }

    class Loan {
        - loanDate : Date
        - dueDate : Date
        - returned : boolean
    }

    Library "1" o-- "*" Book : contains
    Member "1" o-- "*" Loan : has
    Book "1" o-- "*" Loan : involved_in

    note for Library "One library has\nmany books"
    note for Member "One member can have\nmultiple loans"
```

</div>

## 🛠️ Practical UML Example: Order Management System

Let's design a complete order management system using various UML diagrams.

### Class Diagram

        - amount : double
        - paymentDate : Date
        - method : PaymentMethod
