# Low Level Design: The Blueprint of Scalable Systems

ðŸš€ Design smarter: learn how great code is built from the ground up.
> Dive deep into object-oriented principles, master SOLID design, and apply real-world patterns to craft systems that are clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## Learning Path

### 1. [Fundamentals](./01-fundamentals/)

Start with LLD basics and UML diagrams.

### 2. [SOLID Principles](./02-solid-principles/)

Learn the five fundamental principles of object-oriented design:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### 3. [Design Patterns](./03-design-patterns/)

23 Gang of Four patterns with examples:

- Creational (Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.)
- Structural (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, etc.)
- Behavioral (Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.)

### 4. [Case Studies](./05-case-studies/)

Real-world system design problems:

- Parking Lot System
- Elevator System
- Chat Application
- Library Management
- E-commerce System
