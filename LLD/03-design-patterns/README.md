# 🎨 Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced object-oriented software developers. This section covers all 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns with detailed explanations, examples, and real-world implementations.

## 🎯 What are Design Patterns?

> Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

### Key Benefits
- **Reusability**: Proven solutions that can be applied to similar problems
- **Communication**: Common vocabulary for developers
- **Best Practices**: Encapsulate expert knowledge and experience
- **Flexibility**: Make code more flexible and maintainable

## 🏗️ Creational Patterns

**Purpose**: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

| Pattern | Purpose | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [**Singleton**](./creational/01-singleton.md) | Ensure only one instance exists | Need exactly one instance (DB connection, logger) |
| [**Factory Method**](./creational/02-factory-method.md) | Create objects without specifying exact classes | Object creation logic is complex or varies |
| [**Abstract Factory**](./creational/03-abstract-factory.md) | Create families of related objects | Need to create groups of related objects |
| [**Builder**](./creational/04-builder.md) | Construct complex objects step by step | Objects have many optional parameters |
| [**Prototype**](./creational/05-prototype.md) | Create objects by cloning existing instances | Object creation is expensive |

### Creational Patterns Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Object Creation Need] --> B{Complexity?}
    B -->|Simple| C[Factory Method]
    B -->|Complex| D[Builder]
    B -->|Single Instance| E[Singleton]
    B -->|Clone Existing| F[Prototype]
    B -->|Family of Objects| G[Abstract Factory]
```

## 🏛️ Structural Patterns

**Purpose**: Deal with object composition, forming larger structures from individual objects.

| Pattern | Purpose | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [**Adapter**](./structural/01-adapter.md) | Allow incompatible interfaces to work together | Integrate existing classes with incompatible interfaces |
| [**Decorator**](./structural/02-decorator.md) | Add behavior to objects dynamically | Need to add responsibilities without subclassing |
| [**Facade**](./structural/03-facade.md) | Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem | Want to hide complexity of subsystem |
| [**Composite**](./structural/04-composite.md) | Compose objects into tree structures | Need to treat individual and composite objects uniformly |
| [**Bridge**](./structural/05-bridge.md) | Separate abstraction from implementation | Want to avoid permanent binding between abstraction and implementation |
| [**Flyweight**](./structural/06-flyweight.md) | Share objects efficiently to support large numbers | Need to support large numbers of fine-grained objects |
| [**Proxy**](./structural/07-proxy.md) | Provide placeholder/surrogate for another object | Need to control access to another object |

### Structural Patterns Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Structure Problem] --> B{Type?}
    B -->|Interface Mismatch| C[Adapter]
    B -->|Add Behavior| D[Decorator]
    B -->|Simplify Complex System| E[Facade]
    B -->|Tree Structure| F[Composite]
    B -->|Separate Concerns| G[Bridge]
    B -->|Memory Optimization| H[Flyweight]
    B -->|Control Access| I[Proxy]
```

## 🎭 Behavioral Patterns

**Purpose**: Focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.

| Pattern | Purpose | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| [**Observer**](./behavioral/01-observer.md) | Define one-to-many dependency between objects | Changes to one object require updating multiple objects |
| [**Strategy**](./behavioral/02-strategy.md) | Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable | Have multiple ways to perform a task |
| [**Command**](./behavioral/03-command.md) | Encapsulate requests as objects | Need to parameterize objects with operations |
| [**State**](./behavioral/04-state.md) | Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes | Object behavior depends on its state |
| [**Template Method**](./behavioral/05-template-method.md) | Define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses override steps | Algorithm structure is fixed but steps vary |
| [**Chain of Responsibility**](./behavioral/06-chain-of-responsibility.md) | Pass requests along chain of handlers | Multiple objects can handle request |
| [**Mediator**](./behavioral/07-mediator.md) | Define how objects interact without direct references | Complex interactions between multiple objects |
| [**Visitor**](./behavioral/08-visitor.md) | Define new operations without changing object structure | Need to perform operations on objects of different classes |
| [**Iterator**](./behavioral/09-iterator.md) | Provide way to access elements sequentially | Need to traverse collection without exposing structure |
| [**Memento**](./behavioral/10-memento.md) | Capture and restore object state | Need to save/restore object state |

### Behavioral Patterns Overview

    A[Behavior Problem] --> B{Type?}
    B -->|Notification| C[Observer]
    B -->|Algorithm Choice| D[Strategy]
    B -->|Request Processing| E[Command]
    B -->|State-dependent Behavior| F[State]
    B -->|Algorithm Template| G[Template Method]
    B -->|Request Chain| H[Chain of Responsibility]
    B -->|Object Communication| I[Mediator]
    B -->|Operations on Structure| J[Visitor]
    B -->|Collection Traversal| K[Iterator]

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use Patterns
✅ **DO use patterns when:**
- You have a recurring design problem
- The pattern fits naturally
- It improves code maintainability
- Team understands the pattern

❌ **DON'T use patterns when:**
- The problem is simple
- It adds unnecessary complexity
- You're forcing a pattern to fit
- Team is unfamiliar with the pattern

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Golden Hammer**: Using same pattern everywhere
- **Over-Engineering**: Using complex patterns for simple problems
- **Pattern Fever**: Using patterns just to use them
- **Copy-Paste Patterns**: Not understanding the pattern before using
