## ⚙️ Round 1 – Technical Interview  

The interview lasted for about **1 hour**, conducted by an **Amazon engineer with 2 years of experience**.  

It began with a **brief introduction**, followed by a few questions about my **previous internship project**.  
After that, the interviewer asked:  

> “What is the difference between **authentication** and **authorization**?”  

I explained both clearly — **authentication** verifies *who you are*, while **authorization** decides *what you’re allowed to access*.  
📖 You can read more about these concepts here: [Authentication vs Authorization – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-authentication-and-authorization/)  

This part took around **5–7 minutes** before we moved into coding.

### 🧩 Coding Questions  

**1️⃣ Minimum Window Substring (Two Pointer Approach)**  
> There’s a virus string `"ABC"` and a DNA string `"FBKHABJDC"`.  
> You have to find the **smallest substring** containing **all letters** of the virus.  

I explained the **two-pointer (sliding window)** logic, walked through a **dry run**, and coded it efficiently.

**2️⃣ Number of Islands (Graph / DFS Problem)**  
> The second problem was similar to the **“Number of Islands”** question on LeetCode, just reworded differently.  

I solved it using **Depth First Search (DFS)** to count connected components in a grid.  
I explained both **time and space complexity**, and all test cases passed successfully.

Though I took around **1 hour 10 minutes**, the interviewer appreciated my clarity and explanation.
