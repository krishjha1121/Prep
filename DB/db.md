- <p style = "color:orange"> 📚 Data </p>
    
    - Data is a collections of raw, unorganized facts and details like numbers, text, images, and more.
    - Data is measured in terms of bits and bytes.
    - Data can be recorded and does not have any meaning unless processed.
- <p style = "color:orange"> ㊙️ Types of data </p>
    
    - <p style = "color:"> Quantitative data </p>
        
        - Numerical Form.
        - weight, volume, temperature, etc.
    - Qualitative data
        - Descriptive, but not numerical.
        - Gender, ethnicity, religion, etc.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Information </p>
    
    - Provides context of the data and enables decision making.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Database </p>
      
    - Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
    - To make real use Data, we need Database management systems. (DBMS)

- <p style = "color:orange"> DBMS </p>

    - A DBMS (Database Management System) is software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently and securely.
    - Advantages :
        - Data Integrity and Consistency : Ensures accuracy and consistency of data across the database.
        - Data Sharing : Multiple users and applications can access the database simultaneously
        - Data Security : Allows different users to have different levels of access.
        - Data Redundancy Control : Eliminates duplicate data by centralizing storage.

<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 📚 DBMS Architecture </h1> </div>

- <p style = "color:orange"> View of Data (Three Schema Architecture) </p>

    - The purpose is to hide unnecessary details from users and make databases easier to use through three levels of abstraction:

        - <p style = "color:green"> Physical Level (Internal Level) </p>

            - Describes how data is actually stored in memory (files, indexes, etc.).
            - Deals with low-level data structures, storage allocation, compression, encryption.
            - Goal: Store data efficiently.

        - <p style = "color:green"> Logical Level (Conceptual Level) </p>

            - Describes what data is stored and relationships among data.
            - Users at this level don’t worry about physical storage details.
            - Database designers (DBAs) use this level to plan the database structure.
            - Goal: Make database easy to design and manage.

        - <p style = "color:green"> View Level (External Level) </p>

            - Describes how users see the data.
            - Different users can have different views of the same database.
            - Uses views/schemas to show only relevant parts of the data.
            - Also helps secure data by restricting what each user group can see.
            - Goal: Provide personalized, secure data views.

</div>

- <p style = "color:orange"> Data Models </p>
      
    - Provides a way to describe the design of a DB at logical level.
    - Underlying the structure of the DB is the Data Model; a collection of conceptual tools for describing
  data, data relationships, data semantics & consistency constraints.
   - E.g., ER model, Relational Model, object-oriented model, object-relational data model etc.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Database Languages </p>
     
     
    - Data definition language (DDL) to specify the database schema.
    - Data manipulation language (DML) to express database queries and updates.
    - Practically, both language features are present in a single DB language, e.g., SQL language.

    - DDL
        - We specify consistency constraints, which must be checked, every time DB is updated.
    - DML
        - Data manipulation involves
            - Retrieval of information stored in DB.
            - Insertion of new information into DB.
            - Deletion of information from the DB.
            - Updating existing information stored in DB.
        - Query language, a part of DML to specify statement requesting the retrieval of information.

<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 📳 Entity RelationShip Model </h1>  </div>

- <p style = "color:orange"> Data Models </p>
    
    - Collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

- <p style = "color:orange"> ER Model </p>

    - it is a high level data model based on a perception of a real world that consists of a collection of basic objects, called entities and of relationships among these objects.
    - Graphical representation of ER Model is ER diagram, which acts as a blueprint of DB.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Entity </p>

    - An Entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
        - Entity can be uniquely identified. (By a primary attribute, aka Primary Key)
        - Strong Entity: Can be uniquely identified.
        - Weak Entity: Can’t be uniquely identified., depends on some other strong entity.
        - Weak entity depends on strong entity for existence.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Attributes </p>

    - An entity is represented by a set of attributes.
    - Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
    - For each attribute, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain, or value set, of that attribute.
    - E.g., Student Entity has following attributes
        - studentId
        - studentName
        - course

- <p style = "color:orange"> Types of Attributes </p>
   
   - Simple
        - Attributes which can’t be divided further.
        - E.g., Customer’s account number in a bank, Student’s Roll number etc

    - Composite
        - Can be divided into subparts (that is, other attributes).
        - E.g., Name of a person, can be divided into first-name, middle-name, last-name.
        - Address can also be divided, street, city, state, PIN code.
    - Single Valued
        - Only one value attribute.
        - e.g., Student ID, loan-number for a loan.
    - Multi-Valued

        - Attribute having more than one value.
        - e.g., phone-number, nominee-name on some insurance, dependent-name etc.

    - Derived
        - Value of this type of attribute can be derived from the value of other related attributes.
        - e.g., Age, loan-age, membership-period etc.

- <p style = "color:orange"> Relationships </p>

    - Association among two or more entities.
    - e.g., Person has vehicle, Parent has Child, Customer borrow loan etc.
    - Strong Relationship, between two independent entities.
    - Weak Relationship, between weak entity and its owner/strong entity.
        - e.g., Loan <instalment-payments> Payment.
    - Degree of Relationship
        - Number of entities participating in a relationship.
        - Unary, Only one entity participates. e.g., Employee manages employee.
        - Binary, two entities participates. e.g., Student takes Course.
        - Ternary relationship, three entities participates. E.g, Employee works-on branch, employee works-on job.

<br> 
<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 📖 Relational Model </h1> </div>

- Relational Model organizes the data in the form of tables.
- Tuple : A single row of the table representing a single data point / a unique record.
- Degree of table: number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation.
- Cardinality: Total no. of tuples in a given relation
- <p style = "color:green"> Relational Model keys </p>
    
    - 🔑 Primary Key : 
        - A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
        - Cannot have null values.
        - There is only one primary key per table.
        - Example : student_id in student table.
    - 🔑 Candidate Key :
        - Any column (or combination of columns) that can uniquely identify a row.
        - A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the primary key
        - Example : In an employee table, employee_id and employee_email both are candidate key, but one is choosen as primary key, and other remains as candidate key.
        
    - 🔑 Super Key :
        - A set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a row.
        - Candidate key ⊆ Super key.
        - A super key may contain extra columns.
        - Example : In a Books table:
            - ISBN is a candidate key.
            ISBN + title is also a super key (but not a candidate key since it has extra column).

    - 🔑 Alternate Key :

        - A candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key.
        - Still uniquely identifies rows.
        - Example : In a Users table:
            - Candidate keys: user_id, email.
              If user_id is chosen as the primary key, email becomes an alternate key.

    - 🔑 Foreign Key :

        - A column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
        - Used to link tables together.
        - Example :
            - In an Orders table, customer_id can be a foreign key that refers to customer_id in the Customers table.

    - 🔑 Composite Key :

        - A key made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a row.
        - Used when a single column is not enough.
        - Example :
            - In an Enrollment table:
              (student_id, course_id) together can be a composite primary key (because a student can take multiple courses).

    - 🔑 Unique Key :
        - Like a candidate key: ensures all values are unique, but can allow one null value (depends on DBMS).
        - Can be used to enforce uniqueness on non-primary attributes.
        - Example :
            - In an Employees table:
              email can be a unique key if it's not the primary key.
    - 🔑 Compound Key :
        - PK which is formed using 2 foreign keys.

# 🔐 Key Constraints

- Key Constraints: The six types of key constraints present in the Database management system are:-

- <p style = "color:green"> NOT NULL </p>

    - This constraint will restrict the user from not having a NULL value. It ensures that every element in
      the database has a value.

- <p style = "color:green"> UNIQUE </p>

    - This constraint ensures that the values in the column are unique.

- <p style = "color:green"> DEFAULT </p> 
   
   - it is used to set the default value to the column. The default value is added to the columns if no value
  is specified for them.

- <p style = "color:green"> CHECK </p>

    - It is one of the integrity constraints in DBMS. It keeps the check that integrity of data is maintained
      before and after the completion of the CRUD.

- <p style = "color:green">  PRIMARY KEY </p>

    - This is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify each entity in the entity set. The
      primary key must contain unique as well as not null values.

- <p style = "color:green"> FOREIGN KEY </p>

    - Whenever there is some relationship between two entities, there must be some common
      attribute between them. This common attribute must be the primary key of an entity set and will become the
      foreign key of another entity set. This key will prevent every action which can result in loss of connection
      between tables.

<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 📙 Normalization </h1> </div>

- DBMS Normalization is a systematic approach to decompose (break down) tables to eliminate data redundancy(repetition)
- It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form, removes duplicate data, and set up the relationship between tables.

- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠 Why we need Normalization in DBMS ? </p>

    - Eliminating redundant(useless) data.
    - Normalization helps in keeping data consistent by storing the data in one table and referencing it everywhere else.
    - Storage optimization although that is not an issue these days because Database storage is cheap
    - Breaking down large tables into smaller tables with relationships, so it makes the database structure more scalable and adaptable.

- <p style = "color:green">  Problems without Normalization in DBMS </p>
   
   - If a table is not properly normalized and has data redundancy(repetition) then it will not only eat up extra memory space but will also make it difficult for you to handle and update the data in the database, without losing data.
    - Insertion, Updation, and Deletion Anomalies are very frequent if the database is not normalized.
    - To understand these anomalies let us take an example of a Student table.

<div align = "center">

| rollno | name | branch | hod  | office_tel |
| :----- | :--- | :----- | :--- | :--------- |
| 401    | Akon | CSE    | Mr.X | 123        |
| 402    | Bkon | CSE    | Mr.X | 123        |
| 403    | Ckon | CSE    | Mr.X | 123        |
| 404    | Dkon | CSE    | Mr.X | 123        |

</div>

- In the table above, we have data for four Computer Sci. students.

    - As we can see, data for the fields branch, hod(Head of Department), and office_tel are repeated for the students who are in the same branch in the college, this is Data Redundancy.

    - <p style = "color:green"> Insertion Anomaly in DBMS </p>

        - Suppose for a new admission, until and unless a student opts for a branch, data of the student cannot be inserted, or else we will have to set the branch information as NULL.

        - Also, if we have to insert data for 100 students of the same branch, then the branch information will be repeated for all those 100 students.

        - These scenarios are nothing but Insertion anomalies.

    - <p style = "color:green"> Updation Anomaly in DBMS </p>

        - What if Mr. X leaves the college? or Mr. X is no longer the HOD of the computer science department? In that case, all the student records will have to be updated, and if by mistake we miss any record, it will lead to data inconsistency.

        - This is an Updation anomaly because you need to update all the records in your table just because one piece of information got changed.

    - <p style = "color:green"> Deletion Anomaly in DBMS </p>

        - In our Student table, two different pieces of information are kept together, the Student information and the Branch information.

        - So if only a single student is enrolled in a branch, and that student leaves the college, or for some reason, the entry for the student is deleted, we will lose the branch information too.

        - So never in DBMS, we should keep two different entities together, which in the above example is Student and branch,

- The solution for all the three anomalies described above is to keep the student information and the branch information in two different tables. And use the branch_id in the student table to reference the branch.

# 📖 Types of DBMS Normal Forms

- <p style = "color:green"> First Normal Form (1NF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns.
        - All the columns in a table should have unique names.

- <p style = "color:green"> Second Normal Form (2NF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the Second Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - It should be in the First Normal form.
        - It should not have partial dependencies.
        - 🧠 what is a partial dependency ?
            - When a table has a primary key that is made up of two or more columns, then all the columns(not included in the primary key) in that table should depend on the entire primary key and not on a part of it. If any column(which is not in the primary key) depends on a part of the primary key then we say we have Partial dependency in the table.

- <p style = "color:green"> Third Normal Form (3NF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the Third Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - It should be in 1NF and 2NF.
        - And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.
        - 🧠 what is a Transitive Dependency ?
            - In a table we have some column that acts as the primary key and other columns depends on this column. But what if a column that is not the primary key depends on another column that is also not a primary key or part of it? Then we have Transitive dependency in our table.

- <p style = "color:green"> Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - This form deals with a certain type of anomaly that is not handled by 3NF.
        - Must be in 3NF.
        - and, for each functional dependency ( X → Y ), X should be a Super Key.

- <p style = "color:green"> Fourth Normal Form (4NF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the Fourth Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - It is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
        - And, it doesn't have Multi-Valued Dependency.

- <p style = "color:green"> Fifth Normal Form (5NF) </p>

    - For a table to be in the Fifth Normal Form, it should follow the following rules:
        - It is in the Fourth Normal Form.
        - The fifth normal form is also called the PJNF - Project-Join Normal Form
        - It is the most advanced level of Database Normalization.
        - Using Fifth Normal Form you can fix Join dependency and reduce data redundancy.
        - It also helps in fixing Update anomalies in DBMS design.

<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 🤑 Transaction </h1> </div>

- A transaction refers to a sequence of one or more operations (such as read, write, update, or delete) performed on the database as a single logical unit of work.

- A transaction ensures that either all the operations are successfully executed (committed) or none of them take effect (rolled back)

- Transactions are designed to maintain the integrity, consistency and reliability of the database, even in the case of system failures or concurrent access.

- <p style = "color:green"> Properties of Transaction </p>

    - Transactions in DBMS must ensure data is accurate and reliable. They follow four key ACID properties:

        - Atomicity: A transaction is all or nothing. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. Example: While transferring money, both debit and credit must succeed. If one fails, nothing should change.
        - Consistency: A transaction must keep the database in a valid state, moving it from one consistent state to another. Example: If balance is ₹1000 and ₹200 is withdrawn, the new balance should be ₹800.
        - Isolation: Transactions run independently. One transaction’s operations should not affect another’s intermediate steps. Example: Two users withdrawing from the same account must not interfere with each other’s balance updates.
        - Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes stay even if the system crashes. Example: After a successful transfer, the updated balance remains safe despite a power failure.

- <p style = "color:green"> Transaction Schedules </p>

    - When multiple transaction requests are made at the same time, we need to decide their order of execution. Thus, a transaction schedule can be defined as a chronological order of execution of multiple transactions. Example: After a successful transfer, the updated balance remains safe despite a power failure.

    - There are broadly two types of transaction schedules discussed as follows:
        - Serial Schedule :
            - In a serial schedule, transactions execute one at a time, ensuring database consistency but increasing waiting time and reducing system throughput. To improve throughput while maintaining consistency, concurrent schedules with strict rules are used, allowing safe simultaneous execution of transactions.
        - Non-Serial Schedule
            - Non-serial schedule is a type of transaction schedule where multiple transactions are executed concurrently, interleaving their operations, instead of running one after another. It improves system efficiency but requires concurrency control to maintain database consistency.

- <p style = "color:green">  🧠 What is meant by a transaction in DBMS ? </p>

    - In DBMS, a transaction is a set of logical operations performed to access and modify the contents of the database as per the user's request.

- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠 What is meant by ACID properties in transactions ? </p>

    - ACID is an acronym used for the properties of transaction in DBMS. It is used to denote the properties of transactions, i.e. Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.

- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠 What is meant by schedules of transactions in DBMS ? </p>

    - When multiple transaction requests are made at the same time, we need to decide the order of execution of these transactions. This chronological order of execution of transactions is called as a schedule of transactions in DBMS. It is mainly of two types, i.e. Serial Schedules and Non Serial Schedules.

- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠What do you mean by serializability in DBMS ? </p>

    - Serializability is the property of a schedule of transactions in DBMS which determines whether the database would be in consistent state or not if the transactions are executed following the given schedule.

<br> 
<div align = "center"> <h1 style = "color:purple"> 📚 Indexing in DBMS </h1> </div>

- Indexing in DBMS is used to speed up data retrieval by minimizing disk scans.
- When an index is created, it stores sorted key values and pointers to actual data rows. This reduces the number of disk accesses, improving performance especially on large datasets.

<div align = "center"> 
    <img src = 'Pictures/indexing.png'  style="border-radius: 15px; height : 450 width: 300px;"> </img>
</div>

- The data in which in the form of table are logically represented but are not actually stored in db.
- They are stored in the form of Data Pages.
- DBMS creates Data Pages (generally of 8KB depends upon db to db).
- Each page can store multiple table rows in it.

<div> 
    <img src = 'Pictures/datapages.png'  style="border-radius: 15px; height : 450 width: 300px;"> </img>
</div>

- These data pages untimately gets stored in the data block in physical memory.
- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠 what is a data block ? </p>

    - Data block is the minimum amount of data which can be read/write by and I/O operation.
    - It is managed by underlying storage system like disks.
    - Data block size can range from 4KB to 32KB.

- DBMS maintains the mapping of Data Page and Data Block.
- we use B+ Tree to implement indexing in dbms as the time complexity for searching, inserting and deleting is O(logn)
- <p style = "color:green"> 🧠 How B+ tree works ? </p>
    
    - It maintains sorted data.
    - All leaf are at the same level.
    - M order B tree means, each node can have at most M childrens.
    - and M - 1 keys per node.
