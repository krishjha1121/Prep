      title: OOPS
      details: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects — reusable units that combine data and behavior. It focuses on key principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, making software more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

      title: Exception Handling
      details: Exception Handling in Java is a mechanism that allows developers to detect, handle, and recover from runtime errors without crashing the program. It uses try, catch, throw, throws, and finally blocks to ensure smooth execution and robust error management in applications.

      title: MultiThreading
      details: Multithreading in Java enables the simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program for better performance and responsiveness. It allows efficient use of CPU by running multiple threads concurrently, making applications faster, scalable, and responsive.

    - icon: 🗑️
      title: Garbage Collection
      details: Garbage Collection in Java is an automatic memory management process that reclaims unused memory by removing objects no longer in use. It helps prevent memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient resource utilization without manual intervention.

      title: Spring & SpringBoot
      details: Spring is a Java framework for building flexible and maintainable enterprise applications. Spring Boot simplifies Spring development with auto-configuration and embedded servers for fast, production-ready apps.
