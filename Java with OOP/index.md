      title: OOPS
      details: Think you know OOP? Here’s a twist -> inheritance isn’t always good, and sometimes abstraction exists without interfaces. Explore how real-world OOP is less about ‘what you write’ and more about ‘HOW YOUR CODE THINKS’.

      title: Exception Handling
      details: Ever wondered what happens when your code breaks mid-execution? Exception Handling isn’t about errors -> it’s about recovery. Java’s try-catch-finally isn’t just syntax; it’s your safety net when logic fails.

    - icon: 🧵
      title: MultiThreading
      details: What if your code could think in parallel? Multithreading lets Java run multiple threads at once -> tasks breathing side by side, sharing power, and pushing performance to its limit. It’s how your CPU learns to dance.
      link: ./MultiThreading/

    - icon: 🗑️
      title: Garbage Collection
      details: What happens to the objects you forget? They don’t vanish, they’re hunted. Garbage Collection sweeps the memory, reclaims what’s lost, and keeps your program lean and alive.

      title: Spring & SpringBoot
      details: How do enterprise apps stay light and fast? With a framework that handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes -> wiring components, managing dependencies, and booting production-ready apps in seconds.
