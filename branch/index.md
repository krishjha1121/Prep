      title: Computer Science (CS)
      details: What really happens behind that blinking cursor? We’re still figuring it out -> but every line of code gets us one step closer.
      link: /branch/cs/

    - icon: 📡
      title: Electronics & Communication (ECE)
      details: What actually happens inside those tiny chips? We don’t fully know yet -> but it probably involves a lot of voltage and a little bit of luck.

    - icon: ⚡
      title: Electrical
      details: What really makes the current flow? We’re not totally sure yet -> but we’ve seen enough sparks to know we’re getting closer.

    - icon: 🛠️
      title: Mechanical
      details: Ever wonder why machines actually move? We’re still figuring it out -> one broken prototype and one burnt motor at a time.

    - icon: 🏗️
      title: Civil
      details: What really keeps a building from falling? We’re not totally sure yet -> but with enough cement, calculations, and hope, it usually stands.
      link: /branch/civil/

    - icon: 🧑‍🔬
      title: Electronics & Instrumentation (EIE)
      details: Ever wonder what those sensors are sensing? We’re still figuring it out -> somewhere between circuits, calibrations, and controlled chaos.
